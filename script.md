Welcome back friends! Let's do an exercise to help reinforce some learning

I added a `getHamster` method here, it works exactly the same as the getDog
and getCat methods. Except it returns a hamster.

Your instructions for this exercise are to first

// Use the getHamster method to determine what the best pet is among the
// cat, dog, and hamster that you have found in the your respective lists
// using utilities.getBestPet(dog, cat, hamster)

The link for the codesandbox can be found in the notes below.

Good luck!
