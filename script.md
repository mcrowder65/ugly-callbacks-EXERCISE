Alright! I think we've been having a little too much fun with all of these dogs and cats.

In order to have even more fun, we're going to introduce breeds of hamsters!

Another function has been written that will return you a list of hamsters.

Your instructions for this exercise are to first,

// Create a getHamster function that takes in a breed, and returns the breed
// if it's found in the result of utilities.getHamsters, if it's not found, then
// it returns "Not Found"
// Then, use the result of getHamster and determine what the best pet is among the 
// cat, dog, and hamster that you have found in the list using utilities.getBestPet(dog, cat, hamster)
